# AR Room Simulation
This is a designing tool used to create 3D walls and insert in over an image using Google ARCore and Unity.


## Motivation
You just moved into a new home and the living room looks a bit empty. You are thinking of adding a new set of furniture but you can't decide on the color, size or style. 

With this tool you could quickly take a picture of your living room and place virtual furniture inside the room. 

## Deployment
Might need to install Android Studio with the Android SDK and JDK for exporting the app to an Android device.

For exporting an app to iOS, Xcode (11.3 or above) must be installed on a Mac running macOS 10.14 Mojave or later. An Apple Developer account is required for signing the application.

## Application

### Creating the virtual environment

As you open the application, you have to choose an image from your gallery or take a picture from the application. 
Next, you will be presented with a default virtual room with the background image set as your room. This is where you could change the size of the walls to fit the background image. You could also chage the camera view by pressing the center sphere and dragging your finger to the left or right.

### Adding the furniture

Now that you have setup your virtual room, it is time to find the furniture you are looking for. If you press the next button, you will be presented by a menu where you could search for and furniture you desire. Once you have tapped on a furniture piece, it will be loaded within the plane boundries. You could move it around and rotate it as you please.
